**HOMER** is a robust, carrier-grade, scalable Packet and Event capture system and VoiP/RTC Monitoring Application based on the [HEP/EEP](http://github.com/sipcapture/hep) protocol and ready to process & store insane amounts of signaling, rtc events, logs and statistics with instant search, end-to-end analysis and drill-down capabilities.

**HOMER** is already used by large enterprises, voice network operators, voip service providers and traffic carriers worldwide, has been implemented as a service in 3rd party voice platforms and is suitable for production. 

**HOMER** 7+ is designed and delivered as a set of modular components and building blocks to be used stand-alone or in combination with other platforms.
<br/>

##### Core Features
* Based on HEP Encapsulation, available everywhere
* Stand-Alone Capture Servers & Agents for any OS
* Supports advanced SIP, RTP/RTCP Reports, RTC Events and Custom protocols
* Multiple Database backend support for Packets, Logs, Timeseries in parallel
* Dynamic Mapping and Correlation for internal and external data sources
* Made by Humans, and Supported by the best community ever


## Introduction
Unlike its predecessors, HOMER Seven is completely dynamic, meaning there are many database, timeseries and logging backend combinations possible - even at the same time! This opens up a number of new use-case options some users might find overwhelming at first - don't worry, *its just about freedom of choice!* If you're unsure or just want a stand-alone capture system, please consider using the below options or joining our friendly [users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/homer-discuss) where our community will welcome and help you move the first steps.

### :hand: Manual Setup
Installing HOMER 7.x is simple and does not require skills other than patience.

##### Requirements
Before proceeding, install the database requirements for HOMER 7.7:
* Postgres 11+ w/ root account for `DATA` and `API`
* Prometheus or InfluxDB for `TIMESERIES`
* _(optional)_ Loki for `LOGS`

Once ready, proceed to install your HEP Stack:
* Install the [sipcapture](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer/wiki/Quick-Install) package repositories
* Install [heplify-server](https://github.com/sipcapture/heplify-server)
  * Configure with your Postgres instance for storing `DATA`
  * Configure with your Loki instance for storing `LOGS`
  * Configure Prometheus scrapers to `HOMER:9096/metrics`
* Install [homer-app](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer-app)
  * Configure with your Postgres instance for `API` 
  * Configure with your Prometheus or InfluxDB instances for reading `TIMESERIES`
  * Configure with your Loki instance for reading `LOGS`
* Install and Configure a HEP Capture Agent
  * Install [heplify](https://github.com/sipcapture/heplify) on a host with SIP/RTCP traffic
    * Configure with your SIP/RTCP portrange and send `HEP` traffic to `heplify-server` on port `9060`
      * example: ` ./heplify -i eth0 -pr 5060-5080 -hs 10.20.30.40:9060`
  * Use a native HEP client in [Kamailio](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer/wiki/Examples%3A-Kamailio), [OpenSIPS](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer/wiki/Examples%3A-OpenSIPS), [Asterisk](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer/wiki/Examples%3A-Asterisk), [Freeswitch](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer/wiki/Examples%3A-FreeSwitch) and [others](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer/wiki)
* Start your services and login on port `9080` as `admin` with password `sipcapture` _(change it!)_
